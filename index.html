By 2021, businesses with more than twenty employees had recovered while businesses with less than five employees still had not recovered a significant percentage of their sales. These results could have been avoided if small businesses had access to government resources and help applying for emergency grants and loans. 
</span><div class="v211_575"></div></div><span class="v211_581">MISSION </span><div class="name"></div><span class="v211_579">Our mission is to level the playing field for small businesses by connecting business owners with opportunities, and cultivating a community for small business entrepreneurs.</span><span class="v211_520">Small businesses form the backbone of local communities and the national economy. In New York City, small businesses employ more than half of the private workforce and that percentage is growing. They also consistently create more job growth than larger businesses on a national scale. Small businesses serve as community cornerstones, and their success supports the economic success of everyone in the community; when you spend $100 at a small business, $48 stays in the community, compared to $14 at a larger store. That is the power of local ownership and local employees. 
Yet during COVID, small businesses, especially minority and women owned small businesses, were hardest hit and least helped. According to the Stanford-Stripe survey of small businesses, the smaller the business, the more of a decrease in sales it saw during COVID. Furthermore, while businesses with over 20 employees forecasted a full recovery from the pandemic, businesses with less than five employees were still predicting large negative financial effects from the pandemic into 2021.
The Stanford Stripe Survey also revealed COVID - 19 had larger negative effects on women-owned firms.
Furthermore, the government program designed to help small business during the COVID pandemic, the Paycheck Protection Program, left out minority communities in its first round of loans. This meant small businesses in the hardest-hit communities were excluded from government aid. 
We believe COVID has simply highlighted issues small businesses have faced for years. Government surveys run in 2015 and 2019 found small businesses consistently rank government regulations and legal issues as their top challenges. They also reveal small businesses are not taking advantage of government programs that provide legal aid and financial help. These well known issues contributed to small businesses, especially women and minority-owned small businesses, not receiving the aid they needed during the pandemic.
</span><span class="v211_570">Our counseling services and online guide are designed to help small businesses navigate government resources and regulations, connect to funding, and succeed no matter the economic circumstances. We also provide free technology and marketing aid to level the playing field and connect consumers to local businesses. But we want to do more than help businesses navigate the system that exists, we want to network and organize small businesses into a force for social and political change. Eventually, we hope to serve as a watchdog for small businesses and advocacy group for small business interests.
